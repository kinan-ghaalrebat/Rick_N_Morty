# Contributing to Rick and Morty Universe Explorer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/rick-and-morty-universe/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/rick-and-morty-universe/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rick-and-morty-universe.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. Make your changes
6. Run tests: `npm test`
7. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
8. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
9. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- We use React functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Provide a clear description of the feature
3. Explain why this feature would be useful
4. Consider providing a basic implementation approach
